## Context and Problem Statement

I need a front-end to display the map.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Next.js because i don't see any negative points.
I already use it at work and it will allow to use many react libraries

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Next.js

- 👍 because i already use it at work
- 👍 because it's easy to use
- 👍 because there is refresh on save

### Plain Html

- 👍 because it's the simplest solution
- 👎 because it's not easy to maintain / split the code
- 👎 because there is no refresh on save

### Create-react-app

- 👍 because it's easy to use
- 👍 because there is refresh on save
- 👎 because i would have to choose different libraries (like router)
